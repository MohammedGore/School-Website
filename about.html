        <h3>Our history</h3>
        <p>
            The history of computer science society can be traced back to the early 20th century when 
            the first electronic computers were developed. During this time, computer science as a 
            field was primarily focused on the development and improvement of these machines.
        </p>
        <p class="dark">
            In the 1940s and 1950s, computer science began to evolve as a distinct discipline with the
             introduction of programming languages and the development of software. The creation of the 
             first high-level programming language, Fortran, in 1957, marked a significant milestone in the
              field.
        </p>
      
          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
